# Repository for CS207: Systems Development for Computational Science 
This is a repository for the CS207 class taught at Harvard in the Fall of 2019. While I did not take the class in person, I am currently working through all the materials on their website, including lecture excercises and homeworks. You can find more information about the class on the website: https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2019-CS207/


## Content

- Lectures: Stores all files related to lecture exercises
- Homeworks: Stores the results of all homeworks assignments
